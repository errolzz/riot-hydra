mute current track

allow playlists to be deleted




A track can play when...

1. there are no djs in the room, and a user steps up
2. a djs song ends and the next dj starts playing
3. a dj skips their current song and the next dj starts playing
4. a dj quits while playing a song and the next dj starts playing
5. a user enters a room and a dj is already playing

Each of these assumes there is a next dj, and that the next dj has a song in their playlist
