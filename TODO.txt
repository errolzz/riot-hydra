joining old room, user gets stuck there?

drag and drop songs broken
set hard limit on track name
joining a room causes current dj to reset start date of current video


song ended, didnt move to next DJ
video progress janky
last video played in a player persists into new rooms (maybe only rooms with no current video?)











NOTES:
------------------------------------------------------------------------

A track can play when...

1. there are no djs in the room, and a user steps up
2. a djs song ends and the next dj starts playing
3. a dj skips their current song and the next dj starts playing
4. a dj quits while playing a song and the next dj starts playing
5. a user enters a room and a dj is already playing

Each of these assumes there is a next dj, and that the next dj has a song in their playlist
