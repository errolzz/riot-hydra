joining room with video playing, vid progress doesnt work
make room list live update
video progress stays where it was when you quit dj/leave room



CANNOT REPRODUCE
quitting dj stops track for user, doesnt update room users
video can be paused
joining old room, user gets stuck there?
song ended, didnt move to next DJ











NOTES:
------------------------------------------------------------------------

A track can play when...

1. there are no djs in the room, and a user steps up
2. a djs song ends and the next dj starts playing
3. a dj skips their current song and the next dj starts playing
4. a dj quits while playing a song and the next dj starts playing
5. a user enters a room and a dj is already playing

Each of these assumes there is a next dj, and that the next dj has a song in their playlist
